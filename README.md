This function will print a short message to the command window, giving you an idea when a process might finish. It displays the current percentage done, the runtime until now, the estimated time of completion, the time per iteration, and the number of iterations left.

Alternatively you can capture the text before it is printed and use the text in your own application, e.g. in a GUI.
